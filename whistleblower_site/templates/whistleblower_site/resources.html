This means that no identifying information will be tied to the report, including name, email, or year, in order to protect privacy and anonymity. The system will only receive the report itself and no information on the user who submitted it. While this means it is anonymous, it also means that the anonymous user will not be able to follow up on the report. This includes being contacted with follow up questions, being able to delete past submissions, and being able to view past submissions and their status. Once the report is submitted, it will be out of the anonymous userâ€™s hands. As a result, it is possible that action on anonymous reports may be limited due to the inability to follow up.</td>
          <td>Common users will login with their email in order to submit a report. When submitting a report while logged in, information about the user will be collected and attached to the report, including name and email. This means that the report is not anonymous and will be associated with a specific, common user. This also means that the common user will have access to past submissions, which can be deleted and viewed for status updates. Additionally, common users may be contacted with follow up questions and information if necessary. Therefore, anonymity is sacrificed for a more active role with the submissions once submitted.</td>
